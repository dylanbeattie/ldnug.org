## Want to give a talk?

Awesome. Here's the TL;DR:

* Talks are presented in person, in London, UK.
* Meetups are usually weekday evenings 6pm-9pm
* Talks can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 60 minutes
* Talks should be on a topic that's interesting to developers working with .NET
  * Case studies - did you or your team do a cool/weird/interesting thing with .NET, C#, F#? Tell us about it!
  * Showcases. Got an open source project or library you're working on? Tell us about it.
  * Adjacent tech. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, databases, cloud
  * Developer culture. Career advice, communication, documentation, open source.
* Speakers normally present slides/code from their own laptop; we provide HDMI, audio.
* Dylan usually records sessions on video and publishes them on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LondonDotNet">YouTube channel</a> a few days after the meetup.
