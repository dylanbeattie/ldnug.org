		<h1>Welcome to the London .NET User Group (LDNUG)</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>Since 2002, we've been bringing together developers and software professionals working with .NET to learn
			from each other, share tips and tricks, and keep up with all the latest developments in the world of .NET.
		</p>
		<p>We meet in person, once a month, usually at a company or event space somewhere in central London. Our guest
			speakers range from internationally renowned experts in .NET and associated technologies, to aspiring
			speakers from our community giving their first presentation in front of a live audience.</p>
		<p>.NET sits at the heart of a vibrant, cross-platform development community, and we're interested in talking
			about anything and everything that's related to building software with .NET: deep-dive technical sessions
			about performance optimisations and memory management, case studies and experience reports, and wider topics
			like security, diversity, open source, and development culture.</p>
		<p>Want to give a talk, host a meetup, sponsor us, or anything else? <a href="contact">Get in touch</a> and let's chat!</p>
