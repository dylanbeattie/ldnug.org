	</header>
	<p>Welcome to the London .NET User Group! Since 2002, we've been bringing together developers and software
		professionals working with .NET to learn from each other, share tips and tricks, and keep up with all the latest
		developments in the world of .NET.</p>
	<p>We aim to meet in person, once a month, usually at a company or event space somewhere in central London. Our
		guest speakers range from internationally renowned experts in .NET and associated technologies, to aspiring
		speakers from our community giving their first presentation in front of a live audience.</p>
	<p>.NET sits at the heart of a vibrant, cross-platform development community, and we're interested in talking about
		anything and everything that's related to building software with .NET: deep-dive technical sessions about
		performance optimisations and memory management, case studies and experience reports, and wider topics like
		security, diversity, open source, and development culture.</p>
